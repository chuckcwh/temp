## The idea behind **eBeeCare**

Many patients spend several hours commuting to and from the hospital for simple treatments like wound dressing, which were totally 
unnecessary. Also, patients often spend time waiting for treatments. Improvements can be made to the current home care system. Hence, 
eBeeCare was born.

eBeeCare serves as a trusted online platform, letting you book flexible & affordable home heathcare services provided by nurses, 
therapists & trained attendants. We understand the constraints in life. We feel what you are going through and know the best solution. Let’s work together to care for your loved ones and your well-being. Caregiving is truly a test of one’s character strength, perseverance and unconditional love but it should never become a burden.

## Our Core Values

Affordable | Quality | Flexibility | Holistic | Continuity of Care

## How eBeeCare works

We operate like bee’s colonies as we aim to build an efficient and sustainable home healthcare ecosystem for our community. eBeeCare 
has built up a network of nurses, therapists and specialists who conduct home-visits in the privacy and convenience of one’s home. 
Clients looking for professional nursing services at home simply log into eBeeCare’s website, iOS or Android mobile app to indicate the type of service they need, date, time and venue. The system automatically matches the most suitable caregiveravailable. After the caregiver has completed the required procedure, patient condition data is filled up for optimal patient care.
 
In addition to providing patients with necessary support, eBeeCare also offers new job opportunities to nurses who want part-time work or wish to work directly with the community in their neighbourhood.
