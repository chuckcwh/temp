            <p>
              This Client Terms of Service (the "Agreement") is a contract between you (the "Client" or "you") and eBeeCare Pte Ltd ("eBeeCare", "we" or "us"). You must read, agree with and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement in order to use our website located at www.eBeeCare.com (the "Site") and related software and services (collectively, the "Platform"). eBeeCare may amend this Agreement at any time by posting a revised version on the Site or by sending out emails to the affected Client. Each revised version will state its effective date, which will be on or after the date we post it. If the revised version materially reduces your rights or increases your responsibilities, we may post it in advance of the effective date in order to give you notice. Your continued use of the Platform after the effective date of a revised version of this Agreement constitutes your acceptance of its terms. In the event of a conflict between eBeeCare's policies (as stated on the site and may be amended from time to time) and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail. Capitalized terms are defined throughout the Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY CHECKING THE BOX AND CLICKING THE "SUBMIT" BUTTON, OR BY USING THE PLATFORM, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM.

            <h4>1.2. Purpose of the Platform</h4>
            <p>
              The Platform allows Clients and Nurses to identify each other and enable them to buy and sell Services online. Under this Agreement, eBeeCare provides services to both Clients and Nurses, including curating Clients and Nurses, facilitating the formation of contracts between Clients and Nurses, and managing disputes related to those contracts. Clients put up requests for nursing services and invite Nurses to apply. Nurses post profiles and provide quotes on Cases. If a Client and Nurse agree on terms, a Participation Agreement is formed directly between such Client and Nurse subject to the provisions set forth in Annex A (Participation Agreement Between Client and Nurse). eBeeCare collects payment from Client in connection with their receipt of services from Nurse through the Platform. eBeeCare pays Nurse in connection with their delivery of services through the Platform after deducting relevant fees such as the Admin Fees.

              Client shall pay the agreed-upon amount (i.e. the Service Fee) at the time of a Case confirmation (i.e. when the client confirms and accepts the Nurse's Service with terms as specified in Participation Agreement) to their eBeeCare account, which eBeeCare would subsequently transfer (on the Client's behalf) the Nurse Fee to the appointed Nurse's eBeeCare account. This, however, is not an indication of a confirmed payment to Nurse. Payment of the Nurse Fee will only be made available to the Nurse once he/she has discharged all obligations as laid out in the Nurse Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Client hereby authorizes eBeeCare to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by Client, to store credit card details as Client's method of payment for Services, and to charge Client's credit card (or any other form of payment selected which will also authorize eBeeCare to charge the Client). eBeeCare may, in its sole discretion, deviate from its typical billing at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Client selects the mode of payment, he/she is authorizing eBeeCare to make the appropriate charge of payment through that mode of payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Client agrees that Service Fees are non-refundable.
            </p>
            <p>
              eBeeCare bears no responsibility for any payment made between Clients and External Parties.

              6.2. Fees Payable to eBeeCare
            </h4>
            <p>
              The Service Fee and any other additional fees (stated in clause 6.4) shall be due and payable by the Client upon confirmation of the Nurse (when the contract between both parties are formed as set forth in Annex A, in normal circumstances - when contact details between both parties are exchanged). Such fees shall be deducted from the Client's account.
            </p>

              6.3. Non-Payment
            </h4>
            <p>
              If Client fails to pay amounts due under this Agreement, whether by cancelling Client's credit card, initiating an improper chargeback, or any other means, Client's eBeeCare account will be suspended or terminated, no additional payments will be processed, and any future appointments will be cancelled. Without limiting other available remedies, Client must reimburse eBeeCare for amounts due upon demand, plus any applicable processing fees, or charges, including but not limited to (i) legal fees; (ii) Other costs of collection as allowed by law. In its discretion, eBeeCare may setoff amounts due against other amounts received from or held for Client, make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution.

            <h4>
              6.4. Additional Fees
            </h4>
            <p>
              Client may select the most suitable payment methods, at the payment screen, for the Service Fee. Different payment methods carry different transaction fees as determined by the payment gateway. Client is liable for the applicable transaction fee through the payment methods that he/she selects. If the Client elects to pay in foreign currency, Client acknowledges that the payment gateway will add conversion fee. These transaction and conversion fees are in addition to the Service Fee that Client has to pay to eBeeCare.
            </p>
            <h4>
              6.5. Invoices and Taxes

            <p>
              eBeeCare shall have no responsibility for determining the necessity of or for issuing any formal invoices or receipts, or for determining, remitting, or withholding any taxes applicable to Service Fees. Instead, Client shall be solely responsible for determining whether it is required by applicable law to issue any formal receipts for the Service Fees and for issuing any receipts so required. Client shall also be solely responsible for: (a) determining whether Client or eBeeCare is required by applicable law to remit to the appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or similar charges applicable to the Service Fees, and remitting any such taxes or charges to the appropriate authorities on behalf of himself/herself or eBeeCare, as appropriate; and (b) determining whether eBeeCare is required by applicable law to withhold any amount of the Service Fees, notifying eBeeCare of any such requirement and indemnifying eBeeCare (either by permitting eBeeCare to offset the relevant amount against a future payment of Service Fees or by refunding to eBeeCare the relevant amount, such choice to be exercised at eBeeCare's sole discretion) for any requirement to pay any withholding amount to the appropriate authorities. eBeeCare shall have the right, but not the obligation, to audit and monitor Client's compliance with applicable tax laws as required by Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). Further, in the event of an audit of eBeeCare, Client agrees to promptly cooperate with eBeeCare with other documents as may be reasonably requested for purposes of such audit.

            </p>
            <p>
              Without limiting eBeeCare's other remedies, we may suspend or terminate Client account as in accordance, but not limited, to clause 10.2 to 10.5. eBeeCare will also take action if Client actions may cause legal liability for Nurse, and/or eBeeCare or its affiliated parties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once suspended or terminated, Client SHALL NOT continue to use the Platform under a different account or re-register under a new account. In addition, violations of this Agreement may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and may result in additional penalties and sanctions.
            </p>
            <p>
              If Client attempts to use the Platform under a different account, Client agrees that all available funds in such account shall be forfeited, and eBeeCare has the right to deduct all available funds in such account for its own use. .Client will still be liable for any outstanding payments (after deducting from available funds in that account) and any other obligations owed to any parties he/she has incurred while under the identity of this new account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon account termination, Client will be prohibited from accessing any parts of the Platform, including but not limited to data, messages, files and any other materials obtained, created, retrieved or generated from the Platform. If Client wishes to retrieve some data from eBeeCare, Client may write in a request to eBeeCare for approval.

            </h4>
            <p>
              Account suspension or termination shall not relieve Client of the requirement to pay for the agreed and outstanding amounts of any Service Fees to eBeeCare and expenses incurred prior to the effective date of the termination. The outstanding fees and expenses, together with any applicable taxes, shall be charged to Client's credit card or other form of payment.

              10.5. Disintermediation and Solicitation
            </h4>
            <p>
              Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that eBeeCare may have, eBeeCare reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Client account at eBeeCare's sole discretion if Client violates clause 5.3. Regardless of circumstance, Client will bear FULL LIABILITY for any ill consequences that may happen.
