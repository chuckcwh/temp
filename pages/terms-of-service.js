            <p>
              This policy supplements but does not supersede or replace any previous consent which an individual may have provided to eBeeCare, nor does it affects any rights that eBeeCare may have at law in connection with the collection, use and/or disclosure of any individual's personal data. Subject to that, eBeeCare will not collect any personal data from an individual unless the individual has voluntarily chosen to provide us with it.

All updates to this policy will be published at https://ebeecare.sg/privacy and appropriate notifications of any material revisions will be issued to the relevant persons. Subject to an individual's rights at law, the prevailing terms of the policy from time to time shall apply. By continuing their relationship with eBeeCare after any amendments have been introduced and published, individuals shall be deemed to have accepted the policy as amended.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the avoidance of doubt, this policy forms part of the terms and conditions, if any, governing an individual's specific relationship with eBeeCare ("Client Terms of Service", “Nurse Terms of Service”, “Service Contract”) and should be read in conjunction with such terms and conditions. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this policy and terms and conditions, the provisions of the terms and conditions shall prevail to the fullest extent permissible by law.
